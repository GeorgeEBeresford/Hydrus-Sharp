This project was originally designed to get around the fact that Hydrus Network has no support for paging. It was an application I created in my spare time where I dived into the Python code to see how it all fit together.

However, due to the complexity of the database, I'm archiving this for knowledge purposes. I hope it helps a future developer understand a little more about the Hydrus Network ins and outs.
